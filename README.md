### Hi there, I'm Renzo Machado, but you can call me AshGreen1 👋

👨‍💻 I currently work as a **BugHunter at Bugcrowd and Intigriti**, but I'm also a CTF player at **HackTheBox and PortSwigger**. I like to learn and improve my skills every day, so the most normal thing you can see me doing is reading or watching a video about something I don't know to learn it and then practice it.

🙋🏻‍♂️ I'm looking for a job where I can learn from more experienced colleagues or maybe learn new things about pentesting and hacking. But I also want to get a job where my potential can be used.

🔭 I'm currently stuying to get the **BSCP, the PNPT and the ECPTXv2 this year**, because I want to certified my skills and my knowledge.

📫 If you need some help with something (like a HTB box, for example) or maybe you know about a job, here is my email to reach me out! renzo0211@gmail.com
